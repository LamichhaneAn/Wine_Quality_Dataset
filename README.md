Data Cleaning Data Preprocessing Before Building a Model!

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing are essential steps in data analysis before building a model. Here's what they involve:

Data Cleaning: This process involves identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the data to ensure its quality and reliability. It includes tasks like:

Removing duplicates
Handling missing values
Correcting data types
Addressing outliers
Fixing incorrect or inconsistent data entries
Data Preprocessing: This step prepares the cleaned data for modeling. It includes transforming the data into a suitable format and scaling or normalizing it if necessary. Common preprocessing tasks include:

Encoding categorical variables (e.g., converting text labels into numerical format)
Scaling features (e.g., standardizing or normalizing numerical values)
Splitting the data into training and testing sets
Feature engineering (e.g., creating new features from existing ones)
Together, data cleaning and preprocessing help ensure that the data used for building a model is accurate, consistent, and suitable for analysis, ultimately leading to more reliable and effective models.
